## Imaging experiments
Imaging experiments were performed using an inverted microscope (Ti Eclipse) with a 60×Plan-Apo (NA 1.40) objective lens (Nikon) and a spinning disk module (CSU-X1; Yokogawa). All images were acquired with Slidebook (3i – Intelligent Imaging Innovations) at room temperature. Images were captured with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (iXon X3; Andor Technology).
Experiments were repeated 3 times and images were collected in three individual sets, as listed here for N = 1, 2, and 3.
## Image Processing 
Image processing was done on a desktop computer with a Core i9-10900K CPU @ 3.70GHz and 64 GB of RAM, running a Windows 11 operating system. The software was tested on MATLAB 2020b. 

Required toolbox:
- Bioinformatics Toolbox

- Computer Vision System Toolbox

- Curve Fitting Toolbox

- Image Processing Toolbox

- Signal Processing Toolbox

- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

- Wavelet Toolbox

Images were stored in uint16 TIFF format.

For an image with 500x500x75 pixels, it typically takes about 2 minutes to finish image processing.
